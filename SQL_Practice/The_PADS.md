#### Generate the following two result sets:

1. Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
2. Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

An OCCUPATIONS table that contains the following records:

Name            Occupation
Samantha        Doctor
Julia           Actor
Maria           Actor


Sample Output:
Ashely(P)
Christeen(P)
Jane(A)
Jenny(D)
Julia(A)
Ketty(P)
Maria(A)
Meera(S)
Priya(S)
Samantha(D)
There are a total of 2 doctors.
There are a total of 2 singers.
There are a total of 3 actors.
There are a total of 3 professors.




SELECT concat(Name, '(', substr(Occupation, 1, 1), ')') FROM Occupations ORDER BY Name;

SELECT concat('There are a total of ', count(occupation), ' ', lower(occupation), 's.') as total FROM Occupations GROUP BY Occupation ORDER BY total ASC;
